### f64 Math

Looks at how the f64 math instructions work. There are the following

- f64.add = adds $first and $second together (result = $first + $second)
- f64.sub = subtracts the $second from the $first (result = $first - $second)
- f64.mul = multiplies $first and $second together (result = $first * $second)
- f64.div = divides the $first by the $second (result = $first / $second)
- f64.abs = works out the absolute value of a $number (result = Math.abs($number))
- f64.neg = negates the value of a $number (result = -$number)
- f64.ceil = rounds a $number up to the nearest integer (result = Math.ceil($number))
- f64.floor = rounds a $number down to the nearest integer (result = Math.floor($number))
- f64.nearest = rounds a $number to the nearest integer (result = Math.round($number))
- f64.trunc = removes the decimal parts of a $number to the nearest integer (result = Math.trunc($number))
- f64.sqrt = works out the square root of a $number (result = Math.sqrt($number))
- f64.min = works out the smallest value between the $first and $second values (result = Math.min($first, $second))
- f64.max = works out the largest value between the $first and $second values (result = Math.max($first, $second))
- f64.copysign = gives the $number the same -/+ value/part as the given $sign
