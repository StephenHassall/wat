### f64 Math

Looks at how the f64 math instructions work. There are the following

|Instruction|Details|
|---|---|
|`f64.add`|Adds $first and $second together (result = $first + $second)|
|`f64.sub`|Subtracts the $second from the $first (result = $first - $second)|
|`f64.mul`|Multiplies $first and $second together (result = $first * $second)|
|`f64.div`|Divides the $first by the $second (result = $first / $second)|
|`f64.abs`|Works out the absolute value of a $number (result = Math.abs($number))|
|`f64.neg`|Negates the value of a $number (result = -$number)|
|`f64.ceil`|Rounds a $number up to the nearest integer (result = Math.ceil($number))|
|`f64.floor`|Rounds a $number down to the nearest integer (result = Math.floor($number))|
|`f64.nearest`|Rounds a $number to the nearest integer (result = Math.round($number))|
|`f64.trunc`|Removes the decimal parts of a $number to the nearest integer (result = Math.trunc($number))|
|`f64.sqrt`|Works out the square root of a $number (result = Math.sqrt($number))|
|`f64.min`|Works out the smallest value between the $first and $second values (result = Math.min($first, $second))|
|`f64.max`|Works out the largest value between the $first and $second values (result = Math.max($first, $second))|
|`f64.copysign`|Gives the $number the same -/+ value/part as the given $sign|
