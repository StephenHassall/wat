### Math

WASM does not have a number of math functions that are common in other programming languages. Therefore
I have created some of them, which you can use within your own WAT code.

All functions are prefixed with "math_" The current functions available are as follows.

|Instruction|Details|
|---|---|
|`pow(a, n)`|Raise "a" (float) to by the power "n" (integer)|
|`sin(x)`|Sin function of "x" (radian)|
|`cos(x)`|Cos function of "x" (radian)|
