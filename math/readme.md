### Math

WASM does not have a number of math functions that are common in other programming languages. Therefore
I have created some of them, which you can use within your own WAT code.

The current functions available are

- pow(a, n) = Raise "a" (float) to by the power "n" (integer)
- sin(x) = Sin function of "x" (radian)
- cos(x) = Cos function of "x" (radian)
