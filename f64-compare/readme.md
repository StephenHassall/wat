### f64 Compare

Looks at how the f64 compare instructions work. There are the following

- f64.eq = is $first equal $second ($first === $second)
- f64.ne = is $first not equal $second ($first !== $second)
- f64.gt = is $first greater than $second ($first > $second)
- f64.ge = is $first greater than or equal to $second ($first >= $second)
- f64.lt = is $first less than $second ($first < $second)
- f64.le = is $first less than or equal to $second ($first <= $second)
